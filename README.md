# gpt2-inspirational-bot

GPT2 bot designed to make eye-catching, completely false headlines based on influential outlets.

## Why though?

I think it'd be really funny to have a bot that could automatically generate inspirational quotes for us to use on our LinkedIn community page. They would not be close to accurate, but the more 'clickbaity' they are, the more it treads on the line between reality and fiction.

## What image do we want to portray?

We're going with a company that's:

1. Fast
2. Sexy
3. Very cool
4. Up with it
5. Can dance
6. Wow
